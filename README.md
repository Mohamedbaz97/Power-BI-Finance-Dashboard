Problem Description

As a responsible individual, I've diligently recorded all my daily expenditures using Microsoft Excel. By employing basic sorting and filtering functions in Excel, I've been able to obtain a broad overview of my spending habits. To conduct more in-depth data analysis, I aim to transform my static Excel dataset into dynamic PowerBI dashboards.

##Project Objectives

The PowerBI dashboards are designed to address the following inquiries:

Monthly Expenditures (within a specific year): How much money have I spent each month?
Expenditure by Item Category: What is the distribution of expenses across different categories?
Detailed Expense List: Can I see a comprehensive list of expenses with accompanying comments?
Location-Based Spending: How much money have I spent at various locations?
Purchase Distribution by Price Range: What is the breakdown of purchases in different price ranges?
Quarterly and Weekly Spending Analysis: How does my spending vary by quarter and week?
Average Costs: What are the average costs per week, month, and day?
Food vs. Restaurant Expenses: How do food costs compare to restaurant expenses?
Spending Behavior during Illness: What changes in spending behavior occur when I'm unwell?
Weekday vs. Weekend Spending Comparison: Is there a significant difference between spending on weekdays and weekends?
To address these inquiries, I invested time in planning the necessary PowerBI measures and outlined the visual elements of the dashboard.

Conclusion

Leveraging PowerBI, I successfully visualized my purchase data in an interactive manner. This visualization has empowered me to delve deeper into my spending patterns, enabling me to make more conscientious decisions regarding my financial choices.
